        Yes, there is a Wind Modification System depending on both the strength
        and direction of the wind (except readings between 0 - 2m/sec) and a
        Downhill Modification System for road's decrease in elevation drop (between the start and
        the finish) over 1 m/km. Note that performances without wind
        information or with wind over 2m/sec and road runs with drop over 1 m/km
        are not valid for legal top lists, records or entry standards.
